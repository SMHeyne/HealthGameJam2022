# HealthGameJam2022
 Repository for our Unity Project at the Health Game Jam 2022

This project was developed within 48h during the Health Game Jam 2022.

The intended goal was to show, that even small decisions make a difference for the own point of view. A person that might have a mental difficulty might not be aware of the other possibilities. This way it's very hard to understand, that there might be a way out.

We hope that the little fish in this game show that a helping hand or a gesture might bring some more colour or brightness to someone elses life.
